# Base16 Kitty

My version of [Base16][] for [kitty][].

It departs from the official [kdrag0n/base16-kitty][] repository in a few ways:

- Different color mapping choices. For example, I use a blue cursor.
- No support for 256-color variants. These [defeat the purpose of Base16][issue].
- A build setup geared around only building themes for kitty, not all the templates.
- Ability to override theme repositories. I use this for my version of [Solarized][].

## Usage

1. `make deps` to install [pybase16-builder][]
2. `make update` to clone all scheme repositories
3. `make` to build kitty colors in `./colors`

To use a local scheme repository, run `./register.sh path/to/repo`. Next time you run `make update`, it will include this (overriding the official repository if there is one of the same name).
