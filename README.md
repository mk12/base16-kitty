# Base16 Kitty

My version of [Base16][] for [kitty][].

It departs from the official [kdrag0n/base16-kitty][] repository in a few ways:

- Different color mapping choices. For example, I use a blue cursor.
- Always use 256-color variants, but not via base16-shell, which [defeats the purpose of Base16][issue].
- A build setup geared around only building themes for kitty, not all the templates.
- Ability to override theme repositories. I use this for my version of [Solarized][].

## Usage

1. `asdf install`
2. `pip install pybase16-builder`
3. `./update.sh`
4. `./build.sh`

To use a local scheme repository, run `./register.sh path/to/repo`. Next time you run `update.sh`, it will include this (overriding the official repository if there is one of the same name).
